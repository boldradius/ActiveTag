ActiveTag
=========

A web application library to enable applications to keep state and rendering within the server, and relieve the developer from three time-consuming activities:
* explicit action representation (routes)
* view updates (often through brittle client-side code)
* database transactions.

We are in the process of integrating functionality from the tindr/ScalaTagDiff demo, into this ActiveTag library in order to make it reusable.
